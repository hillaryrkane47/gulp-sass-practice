// Most workflows with Gulp tend to only require 4 different globbing patterns:

// 1. *.scss: The * pattern is a wildcard that matches any pattern in the current directory. In this case, weâ€™re matching any files ending with .scss in the root folder (project).
// 2. **/*.scss: This is a more extreme version of the * pattern that matches any file ending with .scss in the root folder and any child directories.
// 3. !not-me.scss: The ! indicates that Gulp should exclude the pattern from its matches, which is useful if you had to exclude a file from a matched pattern. In this case, not-me.scss would be excluded from the match.
// 4. *.+(scss|sass): The plus + and parentheses () allows Gulp to match multiple patterns, with different patterns separated by the pipe | character. In this case, Gulp will match any file ending with .scss or .sass in the root folder.
